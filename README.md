## Capstone Project Sebastian Granizo (00212771)

# Description:

The project focuses on ladybug detection and segmentation using YOLOv10 and SAM 2 (Segment Anything Model). You aim to use YOLO for detecting bounding boxes around ladybugs and then pass these results to SAM for fine-grained segmentation. Additionally, you are exploring a ResNet-based segmentation model that leverages bounding boxes from a pretrained YOLO model to guide the segmentation process.
