Title: Automatic YOLO-based Detection of Ladybird Beetles in Wildlife Images

This thesis presents the development and evaluation of an automated detection system for ladybird beetles in natural environments using state-of-the-art YOLO-based object detection models. Specifically, three versions of the YOLO algorithm—YOLOv10, YOLOv11, and YOLOv12—were trained and tested to identify ladybird beetles in a dataset consisting of 2,899 wildlife images. The dataset was split into 70% for training and 30% for testing. The main goal is to assess the performance and robustness of each YOLO version in accurately detecting beetles in real-world conditions, contributing to biodiversity monitoring and ecological research.
